# Movies-ETL

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to house Python code that runs an ETL process on a set of files that contain movie data such as movie names, release dates, wikipedia links, imdb links, budgets, etc. Once the data has been cleaned and merged, it is then imported into a PostgreSQL database.
